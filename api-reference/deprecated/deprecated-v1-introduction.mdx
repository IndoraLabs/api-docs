<Note>
  The Indora Labs API is the first programmable compliance refinery.  
  In a single call, you can index, search, and sanitize video, audio, and text across 240+ file types — returning both safe artifacts and structured JSON overlays.

## Welcome

The **Indora Labs API** isn’t just another redaction tool.  
It’s the **compliance layer every system is missing** — one API that makes raw data safe before it enters your pipelines.  

Unlike traditional ML-based detectors that only mask predefined objects (faces, plates, SSNs), Indora lets you define compliance in code:  
*“Only redact police officers’ faces,” “black out all tattoos,” “strip PHI from transcripts.”*  

That’s **programmable sanitization** — fast, cheap, and production-ready.  
Video is processed at ~10 seconds per minute, audio and text in near-real-time.  
No brittle rules. No manual review. Just safe, usable data.  

With support for **240+ file types**, Indora powers:  

- **Indexing** → Extract, embed, and normalize content from any file type (PDFs, DOCs, CAD, video, audio, and more).  
- **Search** → Run hybrid semantic + keyword queries across sanitized data.  
- **Redaction** → Apply natural-language policies and receive both redacted files and JSON metadata for downstream workflows.  

## Authentication

All API endpoints require an **API key**.  
Include it in your request headers:
