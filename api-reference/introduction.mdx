description: "Indora Labs API – The Programmable Compliance Refinery"
---

<Note>
  The **Indora Labs API** is the first programmable compliance refinery.  
  In a single call, you can index, search, control, and sanitize **video, audio, text, and images across 240+ file types** — with policy-backed audit logs, chain of custody, and JSON overlays you can trust in court.
</Note>

## Welcome

The **Indora Labs API** isn’t just a redaction tool.  
It’s the **compliance layer your stack has been missing** — one API that makes raw data safe, searchable, and exportable.  

Define compliance in plain English:  
*“Blur all officer faces,” “black out tattoos,” “remove minors’ names,” “strip PHI from transcripts.”*  

Unlike brittle regex rules or generic vision APIs, Indora is policy-driven, multi-modal, auditable, and fast.  
Video processes at ~10s per minute, while text and audio run near real-time.
