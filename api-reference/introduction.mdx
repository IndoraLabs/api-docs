**Welcome**

**Indora Labs API** is a programmable compliance refinery — one API that makes raw video · audio · text · images safe, searchable, exportable, with policy-backed audit logs and JSON overlays you can defend.

**Define policy your way**

**① Natural language** → rules — “Blur all officer faces after 3:00”, “Black out tattoos”, “Remove minors’ names”, “Strip PHI from transcripts.”<br />
**② Upload your policy docs** → rules — drop in SOPs or legal PDFs; Indora converts them into reviewable, versioned, toggleable rules you control.

**Why teams use Indora**

Policy-driven — explicit, auditable rules (not opaque model magic).
Multi-modal — one surface for video/audio/text/images across 240+ file types.
Court-ready — chain of custody + explainable overlays for every decision.


**Flow at a glance**

File in → apply policy → job queued → status → signed URL + redacted asset ＋ overlay JSON.
