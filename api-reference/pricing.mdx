---

<Note>
  Indora Labs pricing is simple: **pay only for what you process**.  
  Two independent pipelines — **Indexing** and **Redaction** — let you control how your data is refined.
</Note>

## Indexing

Indexing converts raw files into **structured, searchable data** — extracting text, audio transcripts, images, and metadata from 240+ file types. It’s your 
data-preparation layer: enabling search, retrieval, and AI analysis.

Customers can use **Indexing** without Redaction if they simply want to organize and search their data.

| Modality | Description | Price |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Video (with audio)** | Extracts frames, transcripts, and metadata from video + audio in one price. | **$0.04 / min** |
| **Audio-only** | Transcribes and indexes voice recordings, calls, or podcasts. | **$0.01 / min** |
| **Text** | Parses and normalizes PDFs, DOCX, TXT, and other text documents (≈3,000 chars/page). | **$0.025 / page** |
| **Images** | Performs OCR and metadata indexing on each image. | **$0.01 / image** |

💡 **Example:**  
- 10-minute video → $0.40  
- 50-page PDF → $1.25

## Redaction

Redaction removes **sensitive data** — faces, voices, identifiers, PII, HIPAA terms — across 240+ file types. It’s your compliance and anonymization 
layer for CJIS, FOIA, HIPAA, and GDPR workflows.

Customers can use **Redaction** independently from Indexing if they only need sanitization.

| Modality | Description | Price |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Video (with audio)** | Redacts both visual and audio streams (faces, voices, license plates). | **$0.65 / min** |
| **Audio-only** | Anonymizes speakers, bleeps sensitive terms, and scrubs identifiers. | **$0.05 / min** |
| **Text** | Detects and masks PII, PHI, SSNs, addresses, and other identifiers. | **$0.15 / page** |
| **Images** | Blurs faces and plates, removes metadata, and enforces policy-level sanitization. | **$0.05 / image** |

💡 **Example:**  
- 10-minute bodycam video → $6.50  
- 100-page police report → $15.00
