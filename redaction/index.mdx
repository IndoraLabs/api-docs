# Redactions

The **Redactions API** allows you to automatically redact sensitive content from files or videos, 
check status while jobs are running, fetch signed URLs for completed redactions, 
or manage manual redaction boxes.

Use the endpoints below to start redaction jobs, poll for results, 
and retrieve finalized redacted assets.
